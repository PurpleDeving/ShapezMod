    // TODO 2. Look at X3R for Rendering or look at POWAH for animation or look for something that builds up with each spike of the altar above
    // TODO 3. Right click when not assembled should give message (maybe ControllerBlock function)
    // TODO 4. Look at pedestal mod for how to float thingy
    // TODO 5. Change thingy to corresponding black hole. How can it grow? What happens if there are blocks there ?
    // TODO 6. Look at vacuum hopper for how to "eat" items
    // TODO 7. Internal "recipe" handler ? What even is a recipe for this? How to store in save what progress was made? How often do you store that?
    // TODO 8. How to even send items in ? If it just absorbs then it needs items to be launched, or all people will just use a lame dropper from above?
    // TODO 9. Alternatively some guided floating ?
    // TODO 10. Differentiation from this MB to all of the mod ? IDK ? > Will this be the absolute main thing, or just 1 thing ?
    // TODO 11. Interaction of the system ? Possible other MB with Base + Terminal
    // TODO 12. Interaction of the system with FTB Quests or Gamestages etc.?
